        Violence itself takes a different hue to each person that looks at it. I mean, whole societies have justified violence for greater causes. And I think almost every act of violence that seems senseless to everyone has been justified at least to the perpetrator in some way, so understanding that, getting clarity on that, may be a fool's errand. A lot of the frustration, actually a lot of the impediments to healing and finding some kind of resilience, comes from not understanding why, and people get stuck there.        
      </span>

        One thing I knew before December 2012 was that there are good journalists and bad journalists. There are people out there who want to cut corners, there are people who show up to report a story with the story already written in their heads. So I was cynical in some ways because of what I had seen. There's this pack pressure for journalists, and everybody just follows the same channel. And with the tragedy in Sandy Hook, all of that was turned up on steroids.
      </span>

      <span class="blue-span" id="line-4">
        <span class="blue">★</span> 
        It became clear to me that for the preponderance of people who just came in to get the story, a lot of them had come to get a certain story that their editor had told them to get. So in order to file that story, they need X number of interviews, they need a person who will be an emblem of grief, they need a person who will be sobbing, they need a clergyman to talk about faith-all these components that they were assembling. And it didn't really matter who the person was, what their actual feelings were, the fact that they may feel aggrieved by being assaulted with questions that were so predictable, obviously intended to elicit a specific response, that there was great disillusionment among the townspeople. It was a great confirmation in my mind that there are ways where journalism goes completely astray and doesn't deliver the story; they deliver a narrative that's been concocted somewhere off-site from the story, and they just need the appropriate role players, and they will just go around until they find those.

        There was a period- especially around the first anniversary, even around the six-month anniversary of it-the interest of the media reawakened, and they started coming to town, and there was a sense in the community that they didn't really want all the cameras and microphones back on the streets. So the town actually decided-the town leaders, with the input of clergy and other victims groups, and schools even-that maybe on the first anniversary there wouldn't be a community commemoration, but that people would observe it privately, go to their regular church, do what they normally would do. And actually word was put out: If you're coming to town looking for some pictures to take of this, you're not going to see anything, because nothing has been scheduled, above and beyond what we normally do. So there was that sense, and I think it prevails today—you know, don't come here expecting to see something or to experience something that you can't in your own heart.

        <span class="italic">Interview with Don Marxhausen:</span> 
        A main image in my mind: Over on the corner coming up over here, on Bowles Ave., there was a woman in a dress, very well dressed, with a telephone, trying to reach her daughter. I remember so clearly the frustration in her face; it's this image in my head. Thirty-five killed, ten killed —nobody knew what was going on. The only thing I knew is that something bad happened. And what could we do? I didn't know-all we could do was sing hymns and do Communion. To speak to what happened was impossible, because we didn't know.
      </span>

      <span class="red-span" id="line-7">
        <span class="red">★</span> 
        While I'm setting up the altar for Communion, one of my kids—a member of the church, and I couldn't tell you his name anymore—he says,"Pastor." I said, "What?" "Pastor." "What? I'm busy, I'm busy!" "Pastor, Pastor!" So I turn to him, he says, "Pastor, I'm going to tell you what happened today." I said, „What?" He says, "Sometimes, when you're picked on, and picked on, and picked on, you strike back, and that's what happened today." And he walks away. So people poured in, packed the place. I probably didn't make much sense, because I didn't know what was happening. I'm handing out Communion, and this one guy who I just had breakfast with says to me, "Klebold." And I think it's my hearing, I said, "What?“ Klebold." "What?" "Klebold. It's Klebold." And then the name came into my head. They hadn't been into the church in six, eight months. They came for a short time, and then they stopped coming. So I had to go into a deep file drawer to pull that one out. And I said, "How do you know this?" And he says, "Because the police cars are all over their place." I said to him, „You tell them if they need me, call me." And I kept going, "Body of Christ, body of Christ, body of Christ…“        
      </span>
  
      <span class="blue-span" id="line-8">

        That was Tuesday. Yeah. And now I'm starting to lose it-either the next day, it must have been... No, it was Thursday. Well, that day I get a call from Tom Klebold: "Pastor, we need some help." "Yeah?" "I need you to help me bury my son." "When and where?" "Saturday." And then he gave me the name of the funeral home. So the day of the funeral, I had a good pastor friend take my wife in one direction, and I had a policeman in the family-my son's father-in-law—he came with me, because the press are all over you like flies, and we went in another direction to this funeral home, probably about twelve miles away. There were gathered...sixteen or seventeen people. There were the parents, an aunt and uncle, their other son, their lawyer-so six there-myself, this pastor that took my wife, so then another eight or nine people. These were couples they trusted, real close friends. I had a service prepared, but then something told me we gotta talk first. So I said, "Everybody just sit down. I think we need to talk." And there in the next room, behind a folding door, was the casket with Dylan in it. He had Beanie Babies all around him. The opening words were from the father. He says, "Who the hell gave a gun to my kid-we don't believe in guns. Who gave a gun to my son?" I forget what else he said, wasn't much more. Then this one family, the father says, "Your son played at our house, wrestled with our son, and we loved him." Another family knew them in Ohio, and they say, "We just thought you were the neatest family in the world, in fact we moved out here to be near you." So it was that kind of testimony. Like, opposite of what had happened, because here was the body of a son who had just killed a whole bunch of people and here's all this praise.

        We finally did a small worship, and the words I used as text were from the story of King David-his son Absalom tried to steal the kingdom from him. Are you familiar with that David had this beautiful son, Absalom: tried to steal the kingdom from him, caused a lot of deaths. Ultimately he was riding on a—I think a donkey—ran under a tree, his beautiful hair got caught in a tree. David's loyal general, Joab, went and slayed him with darts.Then a messenger comes to tell David what had happened, and David says, "How's my son? How's my son? How's my son?" And finally the messenger says, "Your son is dead." And David goes, "Oh my son Absalom, my son Absalom, I wish it were I rather than thou." So even in death and destruction, a father's love does not quit for his son. And that fit

        <span class="italic">Interview with Marjory Stoneman:</span> 
        I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. My family moved to the United States in 2009, when I was eight years old. The main reason we moved was because of the political corruption and violence in Venezuela. We went back for a month when I was still a kid, so I could get my ID card, so I could be identified in the world as something. When we were there, it was difficult for me to sleep. I didn't feel safe. I felt like at any moment somebody could come to our house and rob us or kill us. So that whole month I was there, I was terrified. One night we started hearing gunshots, and we found out the next morning that our neighbor had been kidnapped.

        It's unfortunate, because I really miss my roots. I miss my family that's still there. I miss my friends, my school. I miss talking Spanish all the time. But it's so bad there that I'm also really, really happy that we moved to the United States. We moved here for a better future, we moved for a better life. Parkland is very quiet, very safe, very controlled. And that's one of the things that left me speechless on February 14, the fact that we moved here for safety, and that I experienced a horrible tragedy at my school. It kind of broke my heart.Moving into the school was sort of difficult. I remember being really quiet all through freshman year. I made friends, but it didn't feel like they were my friends. Freshman year, I kept a lot to myself. I already had my YouTube channel—I started that in seventh grade. I loved making videos and editing them. In fact, what eventually brought me together with people from Douglas was the channel and my videos. And so I brought my camera that day, because I wanted to make a Valentine's Day vlog. I just wanted to highlight all the beautiful gifts-the hearts, the balloons, the moments we were sharing with our friends. Around 2:20 pm, though, it wasn't a Valentine's Day vlog anymore.

        This has all definitely affected my life. I am now an activist. I used to make happy vlogs; now I make more professional messages, and a lot of opportunities have popped up —like Harvard. I would have never imagined having the opportunity to speak there. Cambridge, too. There's obviously the consequence of being sad and remembering and going to Douglas-I'm a junior now, I have to go there for my senior year, and my best friends were seniors. So it's different. A lot of people I've met— Paola, who I'm still in touch with, people from Telemundo, Univision, ABC who want me to intern for them. So definitely a lot of opportunities that help my future have opened up, especially in the film business.

        But what happened happened. I've definitely had those days where I called God out, and I just told him, "What are you doing? Why would you do this to us?" But I accept that it happened for a reason. I wouldn't be who I am if it hadn't happened, and I'm still becoming who I am because it happened. It's tough for all of us to get up in the morning and still go to Douglas and have to walk by the freshman building and see friends and see empty seats. It's hard for all of us. And seeing my teachers not being able to teach some days, having to give us packets or books or have us watch a movie because they re extremely sad. It's very different. We would have just carried on with our school year, taken our AP exams, nailed them. But no. Things happened, and things happened for a reason. So I'm still trying to find out my purpose and what I am meant to do here, I guess. I've prayed for clarity a lot, but I know I'm not going to be able to see what's going to happen next, so I pray upon what will happen next.

        That picture, I'll say, has haunted me the past decade, and will probably do so as long as I'm alive. When I first saw it, I was still in the hospital—it was the first day I was fully awake— and my response was first one of surprise. I woke up, and I had stitches down my stomach, and my parents were in the room and I was under heavy medication. I didn't fully understand what had happened yet, either to myself or to my body or to my classmates. I was shot twice in the back, once in the lower back and once in the upper back, and once in my right toe. That was a ricochet bullet. So I lost my gallbladder, parts of my large and small intestine, and two-thirds of a kidney. I was sent directly to surgery, and ICU for about a week. It took me about another two months to walk; my entire abdomen was pretty destroyed. So you're trying to regain consciousness of the world, and figure out how you're taken from a classroom to this sterile, small ICU room, and I remember this small TV in the corner of the room, and I recognized myself because I was wearing these blue shoes, and I asked, "Why am I on TV?" I remember my parents gave me this surprised look like, Oh, she doesn't know, she doesn't yet understand the severity and the totality of what happened – because I didn't. I had lost consciousness in the room and then towards the end. So I was just surprised, and then I pretty seriously asked that the TV be turned off, like instantly.

        I remember at the end of the year there would be these recaps like "What happened in 2007," and that photograph would always spring up, because there are so few photographs that are available. And I would feel a sense of anger, and sadness, and felt in a very big way that my privacy and my voice was taken from me in multiple ways that day, but especially with that photograph, because it is one of the two or three pictures that have been used in connection to this. And there's definitely a loss of control, being a victim in that space and surviving what we all did-but that photograph added a new layer to this really personal experience that thousands of people, if not hundreds of thousands of people, experienced on that day. You didn't have to be in the building to be impacted by it, by any means. But myself and someone else named Kevin Stern, our photographs were reused much more. So you're capturing effectively the worst day of my life, you're not asking for my permission in that space, and I think it's that lack of permission and that lack of connection-that I don't think is the fault of the photographer necessarily, I'm not angry at him. I think it goes back to the lack of control of the overall event.

        As you can probably tell, I'm still a little bitter about it. I would like to find that photographer, and I tried for a while, to try and understand his point of view from that day. He was on the other side of the lens-and I totally give him credit that he did not know what he was capturing and he had no malice in taking those photos, he just got there as quickly as he could and he photographed what he saw-but I think by being able to put a name and a face and find some details, some context, I'll be able to better understand how that picture came into being. Because right now I have no history of it. If I could understand some more of the humanity of his experience that day, I might feel a little bit less resentful over that picture. But that photograph of me being carried out— everyone at work that I meet, they're like, Oh, you're that girl, you know? It's definitely a weird thing to have, but it is what it is.

        People sent in over sixty-five thousand stuffed animals. What on earth do you do with it? These families are grieving, and the last thing they're going to do is go through this stuff. Are you going to throw it in the garbage? How many teddy bears and candles and statues of Jesus and crosses can you take? They finally incinerated all of it in October 2013. All of it burned down to fit into a three-by-three-by-three box. I was actually helping a couple of the families. One of my tasks was to go through some of their boxes and determine what they would and wouldn't want. There was only one family that did not want to see their stuff, I think, or two. They just didn't want it. We reached out, and we're still keeping it, because you just never know. Maybe one day they'll want

        Occasionally, but we just let that go on its way to sacred soil. I remember there was some nice stuff saying this woman was murdered too— you know, the mom. They always say twenty-six people died, but it was twenty-eight. But that's not what Newtown does: it's twenty-six people, because she was responsible, and he was responsible. They demolished their house, too. You know the town bought the house and now it's demolished? I don't even know where it is. I never went to it. But I know someone who lived next door, and I'm sorry, but I'd either be moving or I'd want that house gone too.
